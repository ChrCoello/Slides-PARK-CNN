# Slides-PARK-CNN
Slide deck for the meetup meeting about CNNs on the 17 Mar 2022.

These slides are largely inspired by the intro course of Stephane Mallat for his chair at College de France (2019 course). This course is available [online](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/stephane-mallat/course-2019-01-23-09h30.htm) (French speaking only) and covers the theory of statistical learning.
